Agile TV Frontend test

What would you have done differently if you had more time? Why?

If I had more time, I would focus on refining the component structure by better separating concerns and creating a dedicated folder for atomic components that can be easily reused. I might also incorporate Storybook to document and share the components more effectively. However, given the time constraints, I prioritized completing the test as quickly as possible while meeting the requested requirements.
